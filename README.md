Ideas

* Tree rings: draw multiple cuts through a tree trunk
* Space filling curves for half-toning, randomize substitition
* Apollonian gasket: draw circles as eyes.
* Monochrome CRT filter with scan lines, shadow mask and distortion caused by the shape of the CRT. Input would be an already half-toned BW image.
